# Hiveminder-Archiver
This is a small utility to pull data from Hiveminder and store it in a local file.  Intended to help me and others get data out before Hiveminder closes at the end of April 2015. (Sadface)

Update (2015-04-23):
As it's much easier to save the pages from the API manually via browser (e.g. http://hiveminder.com/=/search/Task/__page/1/__per_page/1000) than to get the cookies to play nice from my script, I'm going to repurpose this project for 1) parsing the data from the HTML files and 2) formatting those tasks for import for some other to-do software (still TBD).
